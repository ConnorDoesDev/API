### API key
##### This API doesn't require an API key. However, your ratelimits will be much lower and will be shared among everyone that doesn't have an API key.
---
### How to get an API key
##### You may get your API key in our [Discord Server](https://monkedev.com/r/discord). Type out the command, `a!register` in the #commands channel. There you go! You will receive your API credentials in your Discord direct messages.
---
### Ratelimits
##### Each endpoint has a shared ratelimit of 100 requests per minute. The base ratelimit for API keys is 100 requests/min. You may receive a higher ratelimit by boosting our Discord server, voting for our bots/server, etc. Just ask us and we can see what we can do! Additionally, you may become a [Patreon](https://monkedev.com/r/patreon) or link our API in your project.
